  <div class="panel-body"><h1>What is Persistent Storage?</h1><p>Persistent Storage is any device that can retain data even after that device has been powered off. It is also sometimes referred to as non-volatile storage. Persistent Storage is useful because unlike some ways to store data such as, through the use of RAM, the data is not lost when a reboot or crash occurs.</p></div>

It is made up of moving parts and physically writes data on the disk.</p><p></p><p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> On a windows computer, you will notice a drive called the C drive. The letter C, most commonly refers to the HDD. This is because windows assigns all their drives a letter and although the letter C may not be correct, it is the most commonly known name for an HDD.</p></div>

      <div class="panel-body"><p><strong>Definition:</strong> A Solid State Drive is used for the same purpose as a HDD.

        HDDs Vs SSDs(Which is Better)</a>
      </h4>
    </div>
    <div id="collapse3" class="panel-collapse collapse">
      <div class="panel-body"><p><strong>Summary:</strong> Hard Disk Drives come with moving parts whereas that is not a problem with Solid State Drives because they are based around the use of flash memory. Moving parts are generally considered to be problems because they will most likely wear out and be damaged causing an issue to replace the storage drive. Eventually, this would be expensive to continue to replace over and over. SSDs are also considered to move a lot faster than HDDs because they use electricity as HDDs can only read data at a fraction of the speed that an SSD can read data at. SSDs are also smaller thus they are lighter and a lot easier to move and will be found in many different portable technology devices.For example, the macbook air uses SSD’s. In addition, today’s cell phones are only able to reach their thin looks because of SSDs otherwise they would be a lot bulkier.SSDs are also less likely to malfunction than HDD’s. This is because they have error correcting code previously put onto them.SSDs come in lots of shapes and sizes. This ultimately depends on the number of chips they have in them and thus they are a lot more versatile and adaptable than other types of storage devices. Finally SDDs are a lot less fragile than counterparts like HDDs and thus have a much longer lifespan. A real life example where this is seen is between a macbook pro and macbook air. While the Pro may have more storage, it is more likely to break if dropped than the air because it’s parts would immediately be damaged.</p></div>
